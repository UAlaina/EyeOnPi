Week 1 journal:

we started doing the security camera with raspberry pi 4 terminal: 

- setting up the raspberry pi 4 to the monitor
- open terminal.

INSTALL MOTION
- update with 'sudo apt update'.
- install motion with 'sudo apt install motion'.

CONFIGURE MOTION
- Configure motion for motion detection with 'sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf
- then we edited daemon off to deamon on because runs motionn as a backgroud service.(A daemon is a background process running without user interaction)
-we changed framerate to 30.(it was 15) for video quality adjust
- we changed webcontrol_localhost on to off for enabling remote access to the web control interface
- changed stream_localhost on to off because allows external devices to access the live stream
-for threshold it sets the sensitivity for motion detection

ENABLE THE MOTION SERVICE
-sudo systemctl enable motion to start running in the background as soon as raspberry pi is powered on 
-sudo systemctl start motion for starting continuous monitoring and motion detection 

SET UP MOTION DETECTION ACTIONS
- first create the motion_events directory if you do not have it for saving images videos there
- install FTP which will capture images to a remote FTP
- modify the Motion Configuration with 'sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf
- we had some trouble with ftp server
